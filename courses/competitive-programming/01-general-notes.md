## Overview

The steps for solving a problem are:

- Read the problem statement
- Formailze it - if the statement is long it helps having a clean, short mathematical formultion to understand whats happening.
- Invent a solution using some algorithm or technique
- Prove the solution. This may not seem obvious but proving is important in competitive programming
- Implement and test the program
- Debug if not working
- Submit

Proving a solution is correct is important because it turns out that we often base our solutions on assumptions that are incorrect. These may be assumptions about the data that are not in the statement, the assumption may make intuitive sense etc.
