## Overview

The steps for solving a problem are:

- Read the problem statement
- Formailze it - if the statement is long it helps having a clean, short mathematical formultion to understand whats happening.
- Think of a solution using some algorithm or technique
- Prove the solution. This may not seem obvious but proving is important in competitive programming
- Implement and test the program
- Debug if not working
- Submit

Proving a solution is correct is important because it turns out that we often base our solutions on assumptions that are incorrect. These may be assumptions about the data that are not in the statement, the assumption may make intuitive sense etc. This is especially important in greedy algorithms and bounds on running time of the algorithms.

If you find a bug in the code there is an error but do not assume that the error is just in the implementation. There could be an error in reading the statement, an error in the algorithm we used etc. If there is a bug then start with step 1.
