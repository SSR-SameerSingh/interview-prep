## Optimization Problems

There are multiple ways to solve optimization problems

- Dynamic Programming
- Constraint Programming
- Local Search
- Mixed Integer Programming

Generally speaking techniques like DP, CP and MIP give high quality solutions and are guaranteed to find the correct output if you give them enough time. Howrver they do not scale well. Local Search is the opposite - it scales really well however it may not give the correct solution. Hybrid is basically the holy grail of optimization that combines the two.
