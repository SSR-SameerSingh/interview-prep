## Overview:

Various notes I have compiled while preparing for interviews.

Also an information dump of whatever I feel like noting down including notes from random cs courses, quality of life stuff to make using tools easier, tool keybinding cheatsheets etc.


### Note to self:

todo: categorize common dp patterns - tree based dp problems (catalan numbers, tree based house robber), problems without independent subproblems (balloon burst), smallest common superstring/longest common subsequence, problems like knapsack and coin change etc
